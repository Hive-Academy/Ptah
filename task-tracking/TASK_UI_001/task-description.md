# Requirements Document - TASK_UI_001

## Introduction

**Business Context**: Transform Ptah from a functional VS Code extension with inconsistent UI to a professional, polished extension that rivals industry leaders like RooCode, Trae, and GitHub Copilot. This UI/UX revamp addresses user experience inconsistencies, custom CSS maintenance overhead, and lack of proper theming integration with VS Code.

**Value Proposition**: Deliver a cohesive, professional interface that enhances developer productivity while maintaining Ptah's unique Egyptian identity through elegant accents and visual language.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Angular Material 18 Migration

**User Story:** As a developer using Ptah extension, I want consistent, professional UI components that follow Material Design principles, so that the interface feels familiar and accessible while integrating seamlessly with VS Code's native experience.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the extension loads THEN all custom CSS components SHALL be replaced with Angular Material 18 components (buttons, inputs, cards, dialogs, menus, toolbars)
2. WHEN user interacts with any UI element THEN Material Design ripple effects and animations SHALL provide consistent visual feedback
3. WHEN extension is tested THEN Material components SHALL maintain full accessibility (ARIA labels, keyboard navigation, screen reader support)
4. WHEN bundle size is measured THEN Material components SHALL NOT increase bundle size by more than 15% from current baseline

### Requirement 2: VS Code Theme Integration

**User Story:** As a VS Code user with specific theme preferences, I want Ptah's UI to automatically adapt to my active VS Code theme (light/dark/high-contrast), so that the extension feels native to my development environment.

#### Acceptance Criteria  

1. WHEN VS Code switches themes THEN Ptah SHALL automatically detect and adapt within 200ms using CSS custom properties
2. WHEN dark theme is active THEN all Material components SHALL use dark color palette with proper contrast ratios (WCAG 2.1 AA compliance)
3. WHEN light theme is active THEN all Material components SHALL use light color palette maintaining 4.5:1 contrast minimum
4. WHEN high-contrast theme is active THEN components SHALL use system high-contrast colors with bold borders and clear visual separation

### Requirement 3: Egyptian Identity Preservation

**User Story:** As a Ptah user, I want the extension to maintain its distinctive Egyptian identity through elegant accents and visual elements, so that it remains recognizable while being professionally polished.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN chat input field is focused THEN it SHALL display subtle gold accent glow effect using CSS box-shadow (no custom animations)
2. WHEN navigation icons are displayed THEN small Egyptian hieroglyph icons SHALL be integrated using SVG sprites (pyramid, ankh, eye of horus)
3. WHEN color palette is applied THEN Egyptian-themed color variables SHALL be maintained: lapis-blue (#1E40AF), papyrus-gold (#F59E0B), hieroglyph-gray (#6B7280)
4. WHEN hover states activate THEN golden accent colors SHALL appear on interactive elements using Material's theming system

### Requirement 4: Custom CSS Elimination

**User Story:** As a maintainer of the Ptah codebase, I want all custom CSS removed and replaced with Tailwind utilities + Material components, so that styling is consistent, maintainable, and follows established conventions.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN code review is performed THEN zero custom CSS files SHALL remain (all .scss files except global theme variables)
2. WHEN components are styled THEN ONLY Tailwind utility classes and Angular Material theme variables SHALL be used
3. WHEN responsive behavior is needed THEN ONLY Tailwind responsive prefixes SHALL be used (sm:, md:, lg:, xl:)
4. WHEN animations are required THEN ONLY Material's built-in animations SHALL be used (no custom @keyframes)

### Requirement 5: Sidebar Layout Optimization

**User Story:** As a VS Code user with varying sidebar widths, I want Ptah to work optimally in narrow sidebar configurations while remaining usable in wider configurations, so that it doesn't interfere with my workspace layout.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN sidebar width is 300px THEN all UI elements SHALL be fully functional and readable
2. WHEN sidebar width exceeds 600px THEN components SHALL scale appropriately using Material's responsive grid system
3. WHEN content overflows horizontally THEN proper scrolling SHALL be implemented using Material's scrolling directives
4. WHEN touch interactions occur THEN Material's touch targets SHALL meet 44px minimum size requirement

## Non-Functional Requirements

### Performance Requirements

- **Component Loading**: 95% of Material components load within 100ms, 99% within 200ms
- **Theme Switching**: Theme adaptation completes within 200ms of VS Code theme change
- **Bundle Impact**: Total bundle size increase limited to 15% maximum
- **Memory Usage**: Component memory usage remains under 50MB during normal operation

### Security Requirements

- **CSP Compliance**: All Material components must work with VS Code's Content Security Policy (no inline styles)
- **XSS Prevention**: All user input through Material components must be properly sanitized
- **Data Protection**: No Material component configurations should leak sensitive user data

### Scalability Requirements

- **Component Reusability**: Material components must be configured for reuse across all current and planned features
- **Theme Extensibility**: Theming system must support future Egyptian accent variations
- **Future Material Updates**: Architecture must support Angular Material updates without breaking changes

### Reliability Requirements

- **Cross-Platform**: Components work consistently across Windows, macOS, Linux
- **Error Handling**: Material component failures degrade gracefully to unstyled but functional elements
- **Recovery Time**: Failed component states recover within 1 second automatically
