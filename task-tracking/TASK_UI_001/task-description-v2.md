# Requirements Document - TASK_UI_001 - Second Attempt

## CRITICAL CONTEXT: Process Failure Analysis

**Previous Attempt Status**: TECHNICAL SUCCESS but USER EXPERIENCE FAILURE
**Core Problem**: Agents migrated chat component to Material Design but left navigation header with overwhelming Egyptian styling
**User Impact**: Interface still shows bright orange/gold header making it look unprofessional despite claimed "9.47/10 quality score"
**Root Cause**: Task was treated as technical Material migration rather than user experience transformation

## Introduction

**Business Context**: Transform Ptah's overwhelming Egyptian-themed interface into a clean, professional VS Code extension that matches modern development tools like RooCode, Trae, and GitHub Copilot. The previous attempt successfully integrated Material components but FAILED to deliver the visual transformation the user requested.

**Value Proposition**: Deliver a clean, professional interface that doesn't overwhelm users with bright Egyptian styling while maintaining subtle Egyptian identity through minimal accents only.

**Critical Success Factor**: User must see dramatic visual improvement with clean, professional appearance matching the reference images provided.

## Reference Design Analysis

**Image #1 Analysis**: Clean dark interface with simple "New Session" header, "Let's build" centered text, card-based design, NO overwhelming colors or decorations
**Image #2 Analysis**: Professional chat interface with simple branding, excellent contrast, minimal visual noise, clean typography

**Visual Targets**:

- Clean, minimal header design (NO bright gold/orange gradients)
- Professional typography and spacing
- Subtle branding that doesn't dominate the interface
- Card-based layouts with proper spacing
- Dark theme optimized for development work

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Complete Visual Transformation

**User Story:** As a developer using Ptah, I want a clean, professional interface that looks like modern development tools (RooCode, Trae, GitHub Copilot), so that the extension feels professional and doesn't overwhelm me visually.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I open Ptah THEN the navigation header SHALL use subtle colors (dark backgrounds, light text, NO gold gradients)
2. WHEN I compare the interface to reference images THEN Ptah SHALL achieve visual similarity to the clean, professional appearance shown
3. WHEN I view the interface THEN Egyptian elements SHALL be subtle accents only (small icons, minimal gold touches) NOT dominant design elements
4. WHEN other developers see the interface THEN they SHALL perceive it as professional and modern, not overwhelming or themed

### Requirement 2: Navigation Header Redesign (CRITICAL PRIORITY)

**User Story:** As a user opening Ptah, I want the navigation header to look clean and professional like the reference images, so that the extension feels polished and doesn't assault my eyes with bright colors.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the navigation loads THEN it SHALL use Material Design toolbar components with subtle theming
2. WHEN I see the header THEN it SHALL have dark/neutral backgrounds with proper contrast ratios, NO bright gold gradients
3. WHEN Egyptian elements appear THEN they SHALL be small, subtle icons only (not large glowing hieroglyphs)
4. WHEN the header is displayed THEN it SHALL match the clean, professional appearance of reference Image #1 & #2

### Requirement 3: Professional Typography and Spacing

**User Story:** As a developer reading content in Ptah, I want clean, readable typography and proper spacing that doesn't strain my eyes, so that I can focus on my development work.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN text is displayed THEN it SHALL use standard Material Design typography scales
2. WHEN components are laid out THEN they SHALL have proper Material Design spacing (8dp, 16dp, 24dp grid)
3. WHEN cards and containers appear THEN they SHALL use subtle elevation and clean borders
4. WHEN content is dense THEN it SHALL maintain readability through proper line heights and spacing

### Requirement 4: Egyptian Identity Minimization

**User Story:** As a user who was overwhelmed by the previous Egyptian theming, I want Egyptian elements to be subtle accents that don't dominate the interface, so that I can use the extension without visual fatigue.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN Egyptian elements appear THEN they SHALL be limited to: small icons, subtle accent colors, minimal decorative elements
2. WHEN colors are applied THEN Egyptian gold SHALL be used sparingly for focus states and small accents only
3. WHEN hieroglyphs are shown THEN they SHALL be small, subtle icons integrated into Material Design icon system
4. WHEN the overall appearance is evaluated THEN Egyptian identity SHALL be recognizable but NOT overwhelming

### Requirement 5: Material Design System Integration

**User Story:** As a developer familiar with Material Design, I want Ptah to follow established Material Design patterns and components, so that the interface feels familiar and well-designed.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN navigation is implemented THEN it SHALL use mat-toolbar with proper Material theming
2. WHEN cards are displayed THEN they SHALL use mat-card with standard elevation levels
3. WHEN buttons appear THEN they SHALL use Material button variants with consistent styling
4. WHEN form elements are used THEN they SHALL use Material form field components with proper validation states

## DELEGATION STRATEGY

**Recommended Agent**: frontend-developer
**Focus**: Complete visual transformation with emphasis on navigation component
**Key Requirements**:

1. Transform navigation header FIRST (remove gold gradients, implement Material toolbar)
2. Compare against reference images at each step
3. Prioritize user experience over technical completeness
4. Validate visual improvement before proceeding to next components

**Success Validation**: User must confirm visual improvement and professional appearance before task completion.

---

**Next Phase**: Route to frontend-developer with emphasis on navigation header transformation as critical priority, followed by visual validation against reference images.
