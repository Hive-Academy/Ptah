# Requirements Document - TASK_ARCH_001_ANALYSIS

## Introduction

**Business Context**: The Ptah VS Code extension requires comprehensive architectural analysis and systematic implementation of critical improvements to achieve production-ready scalability, reliability, and maintainability. The current three-layer architecture (CLI ↔ Extension ↔ Webview) suffers from communication bottlenecks, state synchronization issues, and significant type safety gaps that limit production readiness and developer experience.

**Value Proposition**: Transform Ptah into a robust, type-safe, high-performance extension that rivals industry leaders through systematic implementation of stream-first message bus architecture, comprehensive type safety enhancement, and modern communication patterns.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Comprehensive Type Safety Implementation

**User Story:** As a developer maintaining the Ptah extension, I want complete elimination of 'any' types and implementation of branded types with runtime validation, so that compile-time guarantees prevent production bugs and enhance developer productivity.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN codebase is analyzed THEN zero 'any' types SHALL exist in production code with strict TypeScript configuration
2. WHEN message types are defined THEN discriminated unions with branded types SHALL provide compile-time safety and prevent ID mixing
3. WHEN runtime validation occurs THEN Zod schemas SHALL validate all external data with structured error handling
4. WHEN type coverage is measured THEN 100% type coverage SHALL be achieved with strict TypeScript settings enabled

### Requirement 2: Stream-First Message Bus Architecture

**User Story:** As a user of the Ptah extension, I want sub-100ms response times and reliable message delivery during streaming operations, so that the interface remains responsive and messages arrive in correct order.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN messages are sent THEN message bus architecture SHALL replace direct routing with correlation IDs and promise-based responses
2. WHEN CLI streaming occurs THEN Node.js Transform streams SHALL replace AsyncIterator patterns with proper backpressure handling
3. WHEN communication latency is measured THEN 95% of messages SHALL complete under 100ms (target: 5-7x improvement from current 165-755ms)
4. WHEN high-volume streaming occurs THEN backpressure-aware flow control SHALL prevent UI freezes and message drops

### Requirement 3: State Synchronization and Error Recovery

**User Story:** As a VS Code user experiencing extension or webview reloads, I want automatic state recovery and consistent error handling across all layers, so that my work context is preserved and errors provide actionable guidance.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN webview reloads occur THEN state persistence SHALL automatically restore session context within 200ms
2. WHEN errors occur at any layer THEN structured error hierarchy SHALL provide contextual information with correlation IDs
3. WHEN connection issues arise THEN circuit breaker pattern SHALL enable 99% automatic error recovery
4. WHEN state divergence occurs THEN synchronization SHALL detect and resolve inconsistencies within 1 second

### Requirement 4: Performance and Scalability Optimization

**User Story:** As a power user running multiple concurrent sessions, I want the extension to handle concurrent operations efficiently while maintaining low resource usage, so that my development workflow remains uninterrupted.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN resource usage is monitored THEN memory usage SHALL remain under 50MB during normal operation
2. WHEN CPU usage is measured THEN streaming operations SHALL consume less than 10% CPU during active communication
3. WHEN concurrent sessions run THEN proper session management SHALL support multiple active conversations without interference
4. WHEN bundle size is analyzed THEN performance optimizations SHALL not increase total extension size beyond current baseline

## Strategic Analysis Summary

The architectural analysis reveals **critical production readiness gaps** that must be addressed systematically:

1. **Type Safety Crisis**: Current use of 'any' types creates runtime vulnerabilities and poor developer experience
2. **Performance Bottleneck**: 165-755ms message latency severely impacts user experience
3. **Error Handling Fragmentation**: Inconsistent error handling across layers makes debugging extremely difficult
4. **State Synchronization Issues**: Lack of proper recovery mechanisms leads to inconsistent user state

The **Stream-First Message Bus with Comprehensive Type Safety** approach provides the optimal solution based on 2025 research findings, balancing performance improvements with maintainability and production readiness.

## Constraints

### Technical Constraints

- **VS Code Extension Environment**: Must work within webview limitations and CSP restrictions
- **Backward Compatibility**: All existing functionality must remain operational during migration
- **Performance Budget**: Cannot exceed current resource usage baselines
- **TypeScript Strict Mode**: Must achieve 100% compatibility with strictest TypeScript settings

### Implementation Constraints

- **Phased Migration Required**: Cannot break existing functionality during implementation
- **Resource Limitations**: Must be implementable with current development team capacity
- **Testing Requirements**: All changes must have comprehensive test coverage
- **Documentation**: Architecture decisions must be thoroughly documented for maintenance

---

**Next Phase**: Route to software-architect for detailed evaluation of current codebase against architectural recommendations and systematic implementation planning.

**Priority**: **CRITICAL** - Current architecture limits production scalability and creates maintenance burden that will compound over time.

**Expected Outcome**: Production-ready extension with industry-leading performance characteristics and comprehensive type safety.
