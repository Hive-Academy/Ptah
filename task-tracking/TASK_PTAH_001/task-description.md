# Requirements Document - TASK_PTAH_001

## Introduction

This document defines the requirements for upgrading the Ptah VS Code extension from its current foundation state to a production-ready, feature-complete interface for Claude Code CLI. The project addresses critical feature gaps, UI/UX deficiencies, and technical constraints that prevent the extension from achieving its full potential as a comprehensive AI coding assistant.

**Business Context**: Ptah aims to democratize AI-assisted development by providing an intuitive visual interface for Claude Code's powerful CLI capabilities. The current implementation provides a solid foundation but lacks 60-70% of the planned features and has a basic UI that doesn't meet modern user expectations.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: VS Code Webview Routing Resolution

**User Story:** As a developer using Ptah, I want seamless navigation between Chat, Command Builder, and Analytics views within the VS Code extension, so that I can access all functionality without losing context or experiencing technical limitations.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I click navigation elements in the Ptah webview THEN I SHALL navigate to different views without page refresh or errors
2. WHEN VS Code webview loads with Angular routing THEN the routing SHALL function correctly within CSP constraints
3. WHEN I refresh or reload the webview THEN the current view state SHALL be preserved and routing SHALL continue to work
4. WHEN navigation occurs THEN there SHALL be no JavaScript console errors related to routing
5. WHEN I test in Extension Development Host THEN all routing functionality SHALL work identically to production builds

### Requirement 2: Context Tree Provider Implementation

**User Story:** As a developer managing project context, I want a visual file tree that shows inclusion status and token usage, so that I can optimize my Claude interactions and understand what information is being provided.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I open the Ptah context view THEN I SHALL see a hierarchical tree of all workspace files and folders
2. WHEN files are included in context THEN they SHALL be marked with green checkmarks and show inclusion status
3. WHEN I right-click files in the tree THEN I SHALL see options to include/exclude from context
4. WHEN token limits approach maximum THEN I SHALL see warnings and optimization suggestions
5. WHEN I expand folders THEN file sizes and token estimates SHALL be displayed accurately
6. WHEN context changes THEN the tree SHALL update in real-time without requiring manual refresh

### Requirement 3: Analytics Dashboard Enhancement

**User Story:** As a developer using AI assistance, I want comprehensive usage analytics and insights, so that I can understand my patterns, optimize my workflow, and track productivity improvements.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I access the Analytics view THEN I SHALL see charts showing session duration, message count, and token usage over time
2. WHEN analytics data is collected THEN it SHALL include command frequency, file types processed, and success rates
3. WHEN I view usage patterns THEN I SHALL see insights about peak usage times and most effective prompts
4. WHEN I export analytics data THEN it SHALL be available in JSON/CSV format for external analysis
5. WHEN privacy settings are configured THEN analytics collection SHALL respect user preferences
6. WHEN viewing real-time metrics THEN updates SHALL occur every 5 seconds without performance impact

### Requirement 4: Command Builder Template Gallery

**User Story:** As a developer wanting to use Claude effectively, I want access to pre-built command templates with guided parameter input, so that I can leverage best practices and create powerful prompts without extensive CLI knowledge.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I open the Command Builder THEN I SHALL see categories of templates (Code Review, Testing, Documentation, Refactoring)
2. WHEN I select a template THEN I SHALL see a form with guided parameter inputs and descriptions
3. WHEN I fill template parameters THEN I SHALL see a live preview of the generated command
4. WHEN I execute a command THEN it SHALL integrate seamlessly with the chat interface
5. WHEN templates are customized THEN I SHALL be able to save custom templates for reuse
6. WHEN using templates THEN parameter validation SHALL prevent invalid command generation

### Requirement 5: Egyptian-Themed Professional UI/UX

**User Story:** As a user of the Ptah extension, I want a visually appealing and consistent Egyptian-themed interface that feels professional and modern, so that my development experience is enjoyable and the tool reflects quality craftsmanship.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I use any Ptah interface THEN all components SHALL follow consistent Egyptian design language with gold accents and hieroglyphic elements
2. WHEN I interact with buttons and controls THEN they SHALL provide smooth animations and professional visual feedback
3. WHEN I use the interface in both light and dark themes THEN the Egyptian styling SHALL adapt appropriately
4. WHEN I navigate between views THEN transitions SHALL be smooth and contextually appropriate
5. WHEN loading states occur THEN Egyptian-themed loading animations SHALL provide clear progress indication
6. WHEN errors occur THEN error messages SHALL be displayed in styled containers with helpful guidance
