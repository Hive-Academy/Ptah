# Requirements Document - TASK_UI_002

## Introduction

The Angular webview application for Ptah VS Code extension has accumulated component and styling duplications that compromise maintainability and consistency. This task involves comprehensive code cleanup and standardization to eliminate redundancy, remove deprecated components, enhance user experience with tooltips, and establish Tailwind CSS as the single source of styling truth.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Code Duplication Analysis and Elimination
**User Story:** As a developer maintaining the Ptah webview, I want to identify and eliminate duplicate components and styling patterns, so that the codebase is maintainable and follows DRY principles.

#### Acceptance Criteria
1. WHEN analyzing the webview components THEN all duplicate code patterns SHALL be identified and documented
2. WHEN consolidating duplicate components THEN functionality SHALL be preserved through proper merging or abstraction
3. WHEN removing duplicated styles THEN visual consistency SHALL be maintained across all components

### Requirement 2: Component Cleanup and Removal
**User Story:** As a developer maintaining the component library, I want to remove the deprecated vscode-input and vscode-icon-button components, so that we have a streamlined, focused component set.

#### Acceptance Criteria
1. WHEN removing vscode-input.component.ts THEN all usages SHALL be replaced with egyptian-input.component.ts
2. WHEN removing vscode-icon-button.component.ts THEN all usages SHALL be replaced with egyptian-button.component.ts
3. WHEN components are removed THEN no broken imports or references SHALL remain in the codebase
4. WHEN component removal is complete THEN all functionality SHALL be preserved through appropriate replacements

### Requirement 3: Egyptian Button Enhancement with Tooltip Support
**User Story:** As an end user of the Ptah interface, I want tooltips on Egyptian buttons to provide helpful information, so that I can understand button functionality without confusion.

#### Acceptance Criteria
1. WHEN hovering over an Egyptian button THEN a tooltip SHALL display relevant information
2. WHEN tooltip is implemented THEN it SHALL follow Angular Material tooltip patterns for consistency
3. WHEN tooltip functionality is added THEN it SHALL be configurable through component inputs
4. WHEN tooltips are displayed THEN they SHALL have appropriate positioning and timing

### Requirement 4: Tailwind CSS Standardization
**User Story:** As a developer maintaining styles, I want all custom CSS removed and replaced with Tailwind utilities, so that styling is consistent, maintainable, and follows the design system.

#### Acceptance Criteria
1. WHEN analyzing component styles THEN all custom CSS in component styles arrays SHALL be identified
2. WHEN converting styles THEN custom CSS SHALL be replaced with equivalent Tailwind utility classes
3. WHEN conversion is complete THEN no component styles arrays SHALL contain custom CSS rules
4. WHEN using Tailwind classes THEN visual appearance SHALL match the original custom styles
5. WHEN style conversion is complete THEN responsive design SHALL be maintained across all breakpoints

## Non-Functional Requirements

### Performance Requirements
- **Bundle Size**: Final bundle size increase SHALL be < 5KB after tooltip addition
- **Render Performance**: Component render time SHALL not increase by more than 10ms
- **Style Processing**: Tailwind compilation time SHALL remain under current 3-second build time

### Maintainability Requirements
- **Code Complexity**: No component SHALL exceed 200 lines after refactoring
- **Style Consistency**: All components SHALL use consistent Tailwind class patterns
- **Documentation**: Component interfaces SHALL maintain clear TypeScript definitions

### Accessibility Requirements
- **Tooltip Accessibility**: Tooltips SHALL be screen reader accessible with proper ARIA attributes
- **Keyboard Navigation**: Tooltip triggers SHALL support keyboard focus and activation
- **Color Contrast**: All Tailwind-converted styles SHALL maintain WCAG AA color contrast ratios

## Stakeholder Analysis

### Primary Stakeholders:
- **Development Team**: Reduced maintenance burden, cleaner codebase architecture
- **End Users**: Improved user experience with helpful tooltips and consistent styling
- **VS Code Extension Users**: Better performance and more polished interface

### Secondary Stakeholders:
- **QA Team**: Simplified testing with fewer components and consistent styling patterns
- **Design System Team**: Streamlined component library with clear Tailwind patterns

## Risk Analysis

### Technical Risks:
- **Risk**: Style conversion may introduce visual regressions
- **Probability**: Medium
- **Impact**: Medium
- **Mitigation**: Comprehensive visual testing and screenshot comparisons

- **Risk**: Component removal may break existing functionality
- **Probability**: Low
- **Impact**: High
- **Mitigation**: Thorough usage analysis and replacement strategy before removal

- **Risk**: Tooltip implementation may conflict with VS Code webview constraints
- **Probability**: Low
- **Impact**: Medium
- **Mitigation**: Test tooltip behavior in VS Code webview environment early

### Business Risks:
- **User Experience**: Temporary visual inconsistencies during migration
- **Development Velocity**: Short-term slowdown during refactoring phase
- **Technical Debt**: Risk of incomplete conversion leaving mixed styling approaches

## Success Metrics

### Quantitative Metrics:
- **Code Reduction**: 30% reduction in total component code lines
- **Style Consolidation**: 100% removal of custom CSS from component styles arrays  
- **Component Count**: Reduction from current component count to streamlined set
- **Bundle Size**: Maintain or reduce current bundle size despite tooltip addition

### Qualitative Metrics:
- **Developer Experience**: Improved maintainability score through code review feedback
- **User Experience**: Enhanced usability through tooltip implementation
- **Code Quality**: Improved TypeScript strict mode compliance

## Dependencies

### Internal Dependencies:
- Egyptian-themed component system must remain functional
- Angular Material tooltip module integration
- Tailwind CSS configuration and build pipeline
- VS Code webview compatibility requirements

### External Dependencies:
- Angular Material components for tooltip functionality
- Tailwind CSS utility classes for style replacement
- VS Code API constraints for webview behavior

## Acceptance Testing Strategy

### Visual Regression Testing:
- Screenshot comparison of all components before and after conversion
- Cross-browser compatibility testing in webview environment
- Responsive design verification across different screen sizes

### Functionality Testing:
- All button interactions preserve original behavior
- Input components maintain form integration capabilities
- Tooltip behavior matches Material Design specifications
